## Getting Started

To get a copy of this project running on your local machine you need to follow these next steps...

### Prerequisites

You will need a Linux machine, physical or virtual, your choice.
This project in particular was made using Ubuntu distro.

### Installing

What you will need:

* [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl) - CURL library documentation.

```
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls-dev
```

* [jansson](https://jansson.readthedocs.io/en/2.7/index.html) - JSON library documentation.

```
sudo apt-get install libjansson-dev
```

* [valgrind] - valgrind (manual: TERMINAL).

```
sudo apt-get install valgrind
man valgrind
```

Now you are ready to compile and test the code.

## Running the application

To change the season from where the application will look for the competitions, in the application arguments write the year, if not, it will look for the current competitions.

```
./football_data {year}
./football_data
```

After compiling and with the application running, you can use the following commands:

List competitions:

```
c
```

List teams for a determinated competition:

```
t {competition_id}
```

List games for a determinated competition:

```
x {competition_id}
```

List games for a determinated team in all queried competitions till now:

```
j {team_id}
```

Close the app:

```
q
```

Any other unrecognized command will show all the available commands.
